    "description": "Our president, Aleksander Kopyto, took part in the international Spaceward Bound India Program expedition in Ladakh ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. The mission was carried out at Tso Kar Lake, one of the worldâ€™s highest-altitude salt lakes, whose environment resembles Mars.\nDuring the fieldwork, our Ground-Penetrating Radar project was successfully deployed in the Himalayas, proving its reliability in extreme conditions and delivering valuable scientific results. This is a huge milestone for SkyLink and shows that our solutions can perform in real-world exploration missions!",

    "description": "The AGH Skylink team successfully received SSTV transmissions from the International Space Station (ISS) and was awarded an official certificate by ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station). The broadcast commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo-Soyuz mission and the 40th anniversary of the first two-way SSTV communication during the STS-51F mission. The images were transmitted from the Russian segment of the ISS using an amateur radio system. We thank the ARISS organizers and mentors for this unique opportunity.",

Our team was represented by Magdalena Nowak, ë¯¼ë³‘ì¤€, and Olek Kopyto. We conducted workshops on how CB radios work, where visitors could see their voices visualized on an oscilloscopeâ€”before and after being transformed into a radio wave. Guests also learned the basics of electronic measurements, SDR receivers, and radio modulation techniques. The youngest participants had a blast, but curious adults joined in as well!",
