    "description": "Our Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) is designed for geological research in extreme terrains such as the Himalayas. Mounted on a drone developed in collaboration with the Production Engineering and Energy Science Club at the University of Agriculture, the radar allows analysis of subsurface structures and detection of soil layers. The project won 3rd place at the URK Scientific Societies Session, highlighting its innovation and potential for field applications. Importantly, the radar was successfully deployed during a research expedition in the Himalayas, where it proved its effectiveness and delivered valuable scientific results.",

    "description": "Our latest prototype is a laser-based free-space optical communication system. It uses OOK (On-Off Keying) modulation, where the signal is encoded by turning the laser diode on and off. By integrating the laser and light sensor with a microcontroller and using UART communication, we achieved a transmission speed of up to 37,500 baud. Initial tests confirmed the effectiveness of the solution, opening the way for the development of fast, wireless optical communication.",
