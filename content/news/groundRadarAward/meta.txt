Our Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) project, designed to be mounted on a drone developed in collaboration with the Production Engineering and Energy Science Club at the University of Agriculture, won 3rd place at the URK Student Research Club Session! A great example of the power of interdisciplinary teamwork.
