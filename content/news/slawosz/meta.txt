Today we had the incredible opportunity to take part in a meeting with Dr. Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski — Polish astronaut with the European Space Agency (ESA), engineer, and inspiring science communicator.
The meeting was part of the Post-Flight Tour, during which Dr. Uznański shares his experiences from the IGNIS mission — including experiments conducted in microgravity and innovative technologies developed through orbital research. 🚀
During the event, we learned about life and work in space, experiments conducted in microgravity, and cutting-edge technologies developed thanks to orbital research. Dr. Uznański also shared his career path and insights into what it takes to become an astronaut 👨‍🚀
Representing our student research group AGH SkyLink were
Aleksander Kopyto, Julia Brąglewicz, and Kacper Sikora. ✨
The meeting was truly inspiring — filled with knowledge, passion, and motivation to continue developing the Polish space sector. 🚀
We would like to thank Dr. Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski for sharing his experience and inspiring the next generation of engineers. 🙌
Huge thanks also to the organizers for creating a space to discuss the future of Polish space technologies.✨
