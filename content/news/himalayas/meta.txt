Our president, Aleksander Kopyto, took part in the international Spaceward Bound India Program expedition in Ladakh ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. The mission was carried out at Tso Kar Lake, one of the worldâ€™s highest-altitude salt lakes, whose environment resembles Mars.
During the fieldwork, our Ground-Penetrating Radar project was successfully deployed in the Himalayas, proving its reliability in extreme conditions and delivering valuable scientific results. This is a huge milestone for SkyLink and shows that our solutions can perform in real-world exploration missions!
