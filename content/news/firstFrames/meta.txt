Our ground station, operating within the TinyGS network, has successfully received its first frames from the Tianqi-16 satellite ðŸš€.
Currently, it is capable of receiving LoRa transmissions in the 433 MHz band, as well as signals from stratospheric balloons, including projects such as WTK and AATC.
Great work on the antenna and project idea by Jakub Uchacz and Magdalena NowakðŸ™Œ
